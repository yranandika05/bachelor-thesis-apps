4 apps for comparing CSR and SSR rendering with and without optimization

# Bachelor Thesis Apps â€“ CSR vs SSR

This repository contains four blog applications used for performance and UX comparison:

- `csr-original`: Client-Side Rendering (CSR) without optimization
- `csr-optimized`: CSR with performance optimizations (e.g., lazy loading, caching)
- `ssr-original`: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) using Next.js, no optimization
- `ssr-optimized`: SSR with performance optimizations

All apps share the same Supabase backend and access the same `posts` and `comments` tables.
